# SoccerGraphStats
Python-based Supervised Machine Learning model using graph theory and historical data achieving 69% accuracy in predicting ‘La Liga’ matches.

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a soccer match from La Liga based on variables derived from Graph Theory and historical statistics from the teams. The data for the model is collected from StatsBomb, with 868 matches from ‘La Liga’. Each match is studied as a graph, where the mean positions of the players are considered as the nodes, and the passes between them as edges. The selected descriptors from Graph Theory are weighted density, diameter, weighted transitivity and average clustering. On the other hand, historic winning, losing and drawing rates for both teams are considered, together with their average goals. Additionally, the model contains descriptors related to the historical outcomes of the matches between the two teams.
